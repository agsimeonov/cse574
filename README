Supporting Functions:
================================================================================
perceptron(weights, example):
This function handles the output of a layer of perceptrons (hidden/output layer)
and is used as helper for the feed_foward algorithm function.
A single output is = sigmoid(linear combination of input attributes).
weights : matrix of weights, size m x d+1
weights(i,j) : weight from feature j to unit i
example : vector of attributes, size d
returns layer output

feed_forward(21, w2, example):
This function computes the output of the feed forward algorithm for both
hidden and output layer. Used as helper for nnPredict and nnObjFunction.
w1 : matrix of weights, size m x d+1
w2 : matrix of weights, size k x d+1
weights(i,j) : weight from feature j to unit i
example : vector of attributes, size d
returns tuple (output_hidden, output)

params.pickle:
================================================================================
If you want to read from the params.pickle file it contains the following tuple:
(n_hidden, w1, w2, lambda)
